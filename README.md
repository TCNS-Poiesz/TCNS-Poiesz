# Hi, I'm Annette 👋

🌱 **AI Engineer in the making** — currently on a 30-day sprint to complete the  
[DataCamp AI Engineer Certification](https://www.datacamp.com/) and build a

💡 My background is in **last-mile logistics** and **digital valorisation in food & agriculture**.  
I am passionate about applying AI to **optimize logistics flows**, **unlock digital value** in the food chain, and create sustainable, data-driven solutions.
